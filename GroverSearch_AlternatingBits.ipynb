    "# Finding Alternating Bit Strings Using Grover's Search Algorithm \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we explore Grover's search algorithm, one of the most famous quantum algorithms. Grover's algorithm is an algorithm for solving the following search problem. Given a function $f$ which takes an N-bit input and returns a 1-bit output, 0 or 1, find any input $x_0$ for which $f(x_0) = 1$.\n",

    "First we will define an oracle. In order to define an oracle, we need to know how to implement the function $f$. Grover's algorithm is suitable for problems in which defining $f$ is easy, while finding a value $x$ which satisfies the equation $f(x) = 1$ is not. One example would be a Sudoku puzzle, where it is easier to check whether a grid filled with digits is an answer than it is to find the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example we will consider the function $f(x)$ which is equal to 1 when $x$ is a bit string of length $N$ in which no pair of adjacent bits have the same value. If you think about this, it becomes clear that the solutions to $f(x) = 1$ are bit strings which alternate between 0 and 1. This means that for any $N$ there will be two possible solutions, one starting with 0 and one starting with 1, so the number of solutions $k = 2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our $f$ will look like this:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) =  \\begin{cases} \n",
    "      1 & x = 0101\\text{... or }1010\\text{...}\\\\\n",
    "      0 & \\text{otherwise}\n",
    "   \\end{cases}\\\\\n",
    "$$\n",
    "However, our oracle will not mark these two states explicitly based on our ability to find the solution classically. Instead, it will use binary logic to check the condition by verifying that each pair of adjacent bits has different values. In this way we can build our oracle without actually knowing what the target states will be."
